Details \u00b6 GitHub Deft.Work my personal blog Docker Hub Docker Pulls Docker Stars Docker Build Size/Layers mkdocs-diy Docker Image Build Instructions \u00b6 Build for amd64 or armv7l architecture (thanks to its Multi-Arch base image) docker build -t elswork/mkdocs-diy . Usage \u00b6 The most interesting commands of MkDocs are serve and build , depending on your development environment you can use Make (Makefile) commands that are easier to remember, otherwise you must use docker standard commands. Serve Page \u00b6 Start the live-reloading docs server to preview site while perform changes. make serve Or docker run -it --rm -v $( CURDIR ) :/mkdocs -p 7777 :7777 elswork/mkdocs-diy mkdocs serve -a 0 .0.0.0:7777 Point your browser to http://host-ip:7777 to preview site.
